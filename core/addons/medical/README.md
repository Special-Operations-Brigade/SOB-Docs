Additions to ACE Medical provided by MokTech Industries.

## Introduction

MokTech Core introduces some additional features to the ACE Medical system. The bulk of these changes come in the form of new drugs that can be used by Field Medics to treat medical emergencies in new and interesting ways.

## Additional Bandages

Two new bandages have been added: The **Bacta Patch** and the **Bacta Spray**.

### Bacta Patch

#### Description

The Bacta Patch is a very large bandage capable of covering multiple wounds at once. This is about the equivalent of 3-4 elastic bandages depending on your luck on what's covered in one use. The disadvantage of this bandage comes in its size, it's fairly bulky in comparison to other bandages and does take longer to apply.

#### Advantages

- Highly Effective against multiple wounds, including multiple large wounds
- Moderately long reopening delay, similar to that of a packing bandage

#### Disadvantages

- Bulky
- Takes longer time to apply
- Will reopen

### Bacta Spray

#### Description

A small pressurised container of bacta, this is used to treat large quantities of small wounds on single body parts.

#### Advantages

- Closes almost all small wounds on a body part
- Quickly Applied

#### Disadvantages

- Nearly useless against medium and large wounds

## Additional Medication

The main feature of MokTech Core's medical expansion are the various drugs that have been added. Some of them have a use in field emergencies, while others provide more... esoteric results.

### Batroxobine

#### Description

Batroxobine is a fairly effective coagulant. It's used to slow down the bleeding of wounds. Prolonged use may have an adverse effect on a patient's cardiac process.

#### Primary Effects

- Slows Bleeding of Wounds

#### Side Effects

- Increases Blood Pressure

### Deraformine

#### Description

An experimental sedative that is especially useful thanks to its quick effect. Within 10 seconds of having been administered a single dose, the patient will usually lose consciousness. Side effects and interactions with other medication are not well documented, medics are advised to continue monitoring a subject's vital signs while under the effect of Deraformine.

#### Primary Effects

- Induces Unconsciousness

#### Side Effects

- Unknown

### Glitteryl

#### Description

A potent recreational drug from Ryloth. In high doses, Glitteryl adversely affects a patient's neural pathways, especially those related to the memory. This leads to a nearly full deconsolidation of the subject's memory of the past 24 hours.

#### Primary Effects

- Short-term Memory Loss

#### Side Effects

- Unknown

### Latheniol

#### Description

This drug acts as a highly aggressive depressant on the patient's central nervous system. Within 60 seconds of administration, a subject will enter respiratory arrest followed by cardiac arrest and finally death. Use of Latheniol in the field is not officially sanctioned by GAR.

#### Primary Effects

- Death by Respiratory Arrest

#### Side Effects

- None

### Nevastrin-8

#### Description

A highly aggresive agent that attacks the CNS, can cause spontaneous resuscitation in patients. As concentration rises, the chance for spontaneous resuscitation increases. In all cases, patient's heart-rate will be dangerously elevated after wake-up. Measures must be taken to prevent cardiac shock immediately after resuscitation due to cardiac shock. Application forms so-called Xi-manifolds that permanently degrade the function of the brain, which form after each individual administration. They are considered to be lethal at a magnitude of 5. The RFX/K-Medisensor can reliably assess current magnitude of Xi-Manifolds. Furthermore, Nevastrin-8 is highly incompatible with most opiates such as Morphine.

#### Primary Effects

- Can induce spontaneous resuscitation

#### Side Effects

- Forms dangerous Xi-manifolds
- Incompatible with morphine
- Dangerous increase to heart rate

### Pentabenzadrenolyne (PBA)

#### Description

Pentabenzadrenolyne, usually called 'PBA' or '5BA', is an Adrenal-based stim which increases aggression, reaction speeds and pain tolerance. A double dose additionally induces a sort of 'overdrive' state in a subject, making them nearly unstoppable for the duration. However, after this overdrive effect wears off, the subject's cardiac process will crash and they will enter a life-threatening arrest.

#### Primary Effects

- Increases pain tolerance
- Increases movement speed
- Increases CPR success chance
- Double dose induces 'PBA Overdrive' (see below)

#### Side Effects

- Slightly increases weapon sway
- Moderately increases heart rate

#### Special: PBA Overdrive

The PBA Overdrive State is induced by a double dose of the PBA Stim.
If, at any point, the concentration of PBA in the patient's blood reaches double that of a single dose (800um), a chain reaction will take place.

For the duration of the Overdrive State, the subject will become nearly impervious to pain. Additionally, they will be nearly unaffected by bleeding and other effects of extensive traume.
It should be noted, that a subject in Overdrive State will still be injured, they simply won't feel the effects of the wounds.
As the Overdrive State expires, the stress caused by this mode will crash the Subject's cardiac process, causing them to enter cardiac arrest.

In short, after receiving a double dose of PBA, a Subject will suffer the following effects:
- Unable to bleed out
- Nearly unable to go unconscious due to pain
- Nearly unable to go unconscious due to a critical injury

After the Overdrive State wears off, a Subject will suffer the following effects:
- Cardiac Arrest

### Symoxin

#### Description

A common painkiller found readily available in nearly all corners of the galaxy. While not as strong as Morphine, it has little to no effect on the heart rate, making it a useful alternative for subject's with an already weakened heart rate.

#### Primary Effects

- Moderately suppresses pain effects

#### Side Effects

- Increases blood pressure

### Vutalamine

#### Description

An anti-anxiety drug that sees frequent abuse by the powerful and wealthy due to its relaxing properties, the Special Operations Brigade has ordered a special batch specifically crafted to steady the aim. The lower concentration in the military variant also precludes certain phenomena that commonly occur after long exposure to the drug, including (but not limited to): Paranoia, Addiction, Loss of Memory

#### Primary Effects

- Reduces weapon sway

#### Side Effects

- Reduces movement speed

## Additional Equipment

MokTech Core's medical expansion also introduces some additional equipment to the field medic's toolbag which can be used for advanced diagnosis and to more effectively treat cardiac arrest and similar life-threatning emergencies.

### RFX/K Medisensor

#### Description

The RFX/K Medisensor is an advanced diagnostics tool. It gives an accurate reading on both Heart Rate and Blood Pressure at the same time. Additionally, it can display the patient's current blood volume to better assess hemorrhage incidents and shows drugs currently in the patient's system (and the concentration thereof). The medisensor can also provide a reading on the current level of Xi-Manifolds.

#### Features

- Readout on HR & BP
- Readout on current Blood Volume
- Readout on concentration of drugs in patient's system
- Readout on Xi-Manifolds

### Field Defibrillation Unit

The FDU replaces the medic's sidearm and can be used to direct shocks of high voltage directly to the patient's heart. It can be used to treat cardiac arrest, in order to return a patient's autonomous heartbeat. Use of the FDU on conscious patients is highly ill-advised.

#### Features

- Can return Heart Rate on patients in cardiac arrest
- Causes high amounts of pain on patient

### Reorienting Patients

#### Description

Medics can attempt to "reorient" unconscious patients to force them to wake up. This requires patients to be mostly stable and with good vitals.

#### Features

- Forces wakeup on stable, unconscious patients
