## Introduction

This documentation is for all custom aircraft weaponry, it will be updated as things change, get added, or updated. 

## Different types of missiles 

### Anti Air Missiles 

* Lightings are a short range anti-air missile with a max range of 1.5k kilometers, meant for short burst fighting 
* Typhoon is a Medium range anti-air missile with a max range of 6 kilometers, meant for an all around anti-air missile  
* Hurricanes are long range anti-air missiles with a max range of 8 kilometers, meant for sniping out air targets from a far
* Assasins are medium range stealth anti-air missiles. These missiles will have virtually no radar signature or warning to enemy aircraft, however if they do manage to pop chaffee, more than likely the missile will lose lock.
* All of these missiles need the aircraft to be in the air to lock on and fire, otherwise you will be blindly firing these missiles. 

### Air to ground missiles 

* Hammers are Air to Ground missiles that use both IR and Laser to lock on and fire. With a max range of 6 kilometers, you can use these missiles in a variety of ways.
* Jackhammers are lighter version of hammers. Doing less damage and spread than hammers, they require more missiles to take out a target, however they come fully stocked and ready to go.
* R.O.C.K Missiles are extremely precise missiles that require a laser lock to fire. These missiles have no exposive damage so it must be a direct hit on target, but will kill anything hit
* Stalkers are HARM Missiles are anti-radar missiles. They are meant for anti-air turrets or radar locking vehicles/turrets that are a threat to aircraft. They are meant to auto lock and fire, meaning all you have to do is direct it and let it do the rest. 
* Hitmen are stealth Air to Ground missiles. With no ability to laser lock they must have an IR lock to be able to head to the intended target. 

### Bombs

* Shinies are dumb bombs, which do not lock on in any way and can only be dumb dropped. These are HE so they have the ability to kill light vehicles and large amounts of infantry
* BMTB bombs are smart bombs, which can lock on via laser, and will glide to the target if need be. Do not rely on this bombs ability to turn around in a 360 but it can adjust to target if need be. These bombs are better suited against hard targets like tanks or armored vehicles rather than infantry. 
* the R.O.C.K Bomb is a bomb variant of the R.O.C.K, again it is extremely precise with no explosive damage, but will kill anything hit with ease.
