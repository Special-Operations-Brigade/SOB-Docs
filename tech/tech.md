## Introduction

This documentation is for all things related to the "Tech" project.

## Equipment

### The Technician Datapad

The Technician Datapad is a new piece of equipment which allows the user to hack droids and other technological systems. This item comes equipped with a default set of hacks based around hacking droids and other objects around the user like mines and intel panels. Users can find more information on hacks below in the "Hacks" section.

### The Computer Spike

Learning the correct prompts for a successful hack can be a daunting task and not everyone will be equipped with a datapad. The Computer spike is an item meant to be carried around to more easily complete mission critical objectives. For example: hacking intel.

### The Antenna

An Antenna has been added to allow users with a datapad to increase the power and range of their hacks. With the item in their inventory, they're able to self interact and place the item down on the ground. Once placed, interact with the antenna to connect to it. 

Any "AOE" styled hacks will originate from the Antenna instead of the player once connected, and with an increased range.

## Hacks

### Mine disable 

- Origin: Player 
- Range: 50 - 200 meters

### Radio Scramble 
- Origin: Player 
- Range: 50 - 200 meters
- Duration: Permenant

The user is able to send out a signal to all enemy radios in a radius around them, disabling all short ranges and heavily limiting long range capabilities. Once time is up, the long range will return to normal but the short range will need a repair kit to fuction once again.
