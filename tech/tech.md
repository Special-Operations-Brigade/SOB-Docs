## Introduction

This documentation is for all things related to the "Tech" project.

## Equipment

### The "Techno Pad"

The "Techno Pad" is a new piece of equipment which allows the user to hack droids and other technological systems. This item comes equiped with a default set of hacks based around hacking droids and other objects around the user like mines and intel panels. Users can find more information on hacks below in the "Hacks" section.

### The Computer Spike

Learning the correct prompts for a successful hack can be daunting task and not everyone will be equiped with a Techno Pad. The Computer spike is an item mean to be carried around to more easily complete mission critical objectives. For example hacking intel.

### The Antenna

An Antenna has been added to allow users with a Techno pad to increase the power and range of their hacks. With the item in their inventory, they're able to self interact and place the item down on the ground. Once placed, interact with the antenna to connect to the antenna. 

Any "AOE" styled hacks will originate from the Antenna instead of the player once connected.
