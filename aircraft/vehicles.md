## Introduction

This document covers all the different types of aircraft within the arsenal of X-ray. This document will be updated as needed. 

## Different types of aircraft

### Fighters

* The Z-95 is a cap fighter excelling in maneuverability. While it isn't the fastest in the garage, it can turn at razor sharp speeds and still keep up with the enemy. This aircraft comes equipped with mainly anti-air missiles and light air to ground capabilities. This fighter also features the lightning missiles, short range and quick moving missiles seen on no other class of aircraft. 

* The V-Wing is the fastest of all the fighters, clocking in a max speed of 1300kph this aircraft excels at reaching one end of the map to another in a blink of an eye. While the ability to turn can sometimes been difficult this fighter can outrun almost another given the time. 

* The Delta-7 is the middle ground too all fighters, while not being the fastest it can defiently keep up with the V-wing, while also doing its best to manuver like the Z-95. This aircraft does feature some radar spoofing technology however, getting past 950kph will disapear off of enemy radars, giving it the ability to zooms past anti-air nets without detection. 

### Multi-Role

* The LAAT is the bread and butter of X-Ray. While not being good at one thing in particular it can do the job of multiple aircraft if need be. With the ability to move an entire company of men while also taking out aats and vultures in its way, this aircraft is a solid pick for any pilot

* The ARC-170 is the middle ground of Fighers and bombers. While featuring no major munitions, carries anti-air and air to ground missiles, while also carrying some of X-rays lighter bombs. Like the laat this aircraft excels at nothing but can do anything required of it. 

### Transports

* The LAAT-C is the cargo varient of the LAAT. While being much beefier and less armed, it can carry heavy cargo and vehicles if need be to any destination. 

* The Nu-Class is the shuttle in X-rays garage. It can transport infantry, cargo, small vehicles, and whatever else will fit in its cargo hold. This aircraft is great at performing drops of resupplies and infantry at a moments notice. 

* The LAAT-LE is a light, nimble aircraft meant to carry squad sized elements. This aircraft, while featuring very little weaponry, can move very quickly to transport infantry to the front lines. 

* The LAAT/s is the stealth varient of the LAAT-LE, able to clock out of the sensors of anti-air and aircraft, this laat is meant to deploy assains behind the front lines without detection. 

* The LAAT/LAG is the Drone varient of the LAAT-LE, able to remotely carry infantry to the front lines this is a suicide vehicle. Upon impact it deploys a squad sheild protecting its cargo, while blowing up in the process. 

* The Republic Transport is meant to carry large amounts of vehicles or cargo as needed. The C-130 of x-ray, this aircraft will get you an entire platoon of tanks in one trip. 

### Bombers

* The Y-Wing is the heavy hitter of X-ray. This aircraft features massive amounts of armorment with a massive punch. Carrying large amounts of bombs, missiles, and a nasty front gun this aircraft can decimate an objective without even looking at it.
